# #100DaysOfSwiftUI Project 4: BetterRest

[Better Rest](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/26) was an application designed to show how to use very basic features of CoreML/Create ML.  The data was provided by HackingWithSwift.  I did two of the challenges but did not complete the last challenge which was to always time to go to bed.  When trying to figure out how to do that, I think I want to use ObservableObject.  I dont want to get too far ahead of myself so I will wait.
